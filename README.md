# NetSniper

**HELP WANTED:** 

It would be good to get the community's input on the features of this device. Comments and suggestions for improvement or additional features are greatly appreciated. 

**STATE OF APPLICATION:**

Completed. 

**DESCRIPTION:** 

This is a powershell application that monitors wireless networks and it's devices based on the MAC address. 

Not every computers Ip address is permanent. Therefore, to always constantly scan the same IP address may not be the best way of detecting whether a device status. If the computers IP address is changed, then you'd be scanning the wrong system. However, a MAC Address is permanent. Powershell takes in a MAC Address input from user and finds the IP Address of the system using the MAC Address. For there, NetSniper will ping the IP Address and let the user know if the device is online or offline. 

**REQUIREMENTS:**   

This application works in both Powershell 2.0 and Linux Bash. One-time or Continuous scans are also available in the Powershell versions. The Bash version incorporates both scans into one application.
